Welcome! I'm **Özgür**, an **M.Sc.** graduate in Biotechnology from [**Yeditepe University, Istanbul**](https://fbe.yeditepe.edu.tr/en). My projects span **evolutionary theory**, **game dynamics**, and **developmental mechanisms**, with a focus on building models that reveal how traits and strategies emerge, interact, and evolve. I aim to move beyond fixed assumptions by integrating **frequency-dependent selection**, **trait correlations**, and **self-developing processes** into new theoretical frameworks. Ultimately, my work seeks to deepen our understanding of **variation**, **adaptation**, and the open-ended possibilities of **evolution**.
