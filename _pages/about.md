Welcome! I'm **Özgür**, an **M.Sc.** graduate in Biotechnology from [**Yeditepe University**](https://fbe.yeditepe.edu.tr/en). My work asks where **strategies come from** before asking which ones are selected. I build models where **gene regulatory networks** discover cooperation, **developmental bias** shapes evolutionary trajectories, and **network architecture** determines what selection can find. Rather than treating structure as a fixed parameter, I model how it **co-evolves** with the processes unfolding on it. Current projects span **emergent cooperation** in evolving GRNs, **cancer resistance dynamics**, and the **predictability of evolution**.
