We are able to recognize the disease(s) we call “cancer” due to the convergent evolution. Different tumours from different tissues and organisms converge into the same phenotypes called “hallmarks of cancer” (Hanahan, 2022). The most plausible driver for such convergent trait acquisition is the natural selection (Fortunato et al., 2017).

In his book “On the Origin of Species”, Charles Darwin proposed natural selection to explain steady accumulation of differences often observed across natural histories of animals. This depiction was supported by many paleontological investigations and it has merged with the principles of molecular genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis. This model suggests gradual changes in genotype and therefore phenotype, akin to Rudolph Zallinger’s iconic, though flawed, imagery of ape to man.

Possibly due to the influence of modern evolutionary synthesis, the evolutionary process in cancer is commonly assumed to follow gradual, slow and consistent evolutionary tempo. However, evidence suggests that cancer evolution does not strictly adhere to the selection process as in neutral evolution or gradual changes as in punctuated evolution.  Despite the detection of neutral growth, selection must occur at some stage during clonal evolution in order for a neoplasm to grow within normal tissues (Cross et al., 2016).

Punctuated equilibrium and saltation theory are often confused, but they are distinct. Saltation theory suggests that new species can arise rapidly through sudden large-scale mutations, while punctuated equilibrium proposes that gross phenotypic change results from gradual genetic evolution in isolated populations. Richard Goldschmidt referred to these sudden large-scale mutations as "hopeful monsters," aiming for perfection in a single leap. However, most gross genetic rearrangements are likely to be maladaptive (Graham & Sottoriva, 2017).

Punctuated equilibrium in cancer implies variable and nongradual evolutionary tempos, resulting in chaotic courses. To ensure effective clinical prediction models and therapy responses, non-gradualism must be considered. Punctuation enables rapid evolution, potentially leading to quicker therapy responses than predicted. Current models favor linear mutation rates and single nucleotide variants, but explicit models of stasis and punctuated equilibrium offer valuable insights (Cross et al., 2016).

    In this adaptive landscape, initially only purple species exist, the size of the circle indicates the size of the population. After stabilizing in local minima point, I have let population divide into two subspecies, after these two species evolve to two local maximas, further speciation won’t happen in the same way (i.e., sympatric speciation). Within the gradualist perspective, only geographical isolation (i.e., allopatric speciation) could cause occupation of the leftmost ESS. However, in the cancer case we don’t have to adhere to a gradualist perspective as punctuated chromosomal abbreviations may result in hopeful species (blue) that would land at the ESS.

G-function model assumes a micro-mutation approach that restricts the ways natural selection explores the strategy set. In their book Vincent & Brown, 2005, have mentioned hopeful monsters that would explore the strategy set. However, they have adopted a micro-mutation approach of selecting invaders’ strategies within some small neighborhood of existing strategy values to conform more faithfully to constraints imposed by the genetics. Here I have used an example from their book to show both sympatric speciation and appearance of a hopeful monster.




Although current g-function cancer models have a much simpler adaptive landscape to observe speciation events, incorporation of more detailed tumor microenvironment and effects of multiple drugs could create suitable adaptive landscapes to observe speciation, macroevolution and generation of hopeful monsters.
