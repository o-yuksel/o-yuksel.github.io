How ecologically relevant (Qualitative) types arise from vast space of quantitative field of genotypes? (e.g. De-novo mutations in cancer)

Introducing developmental mechanisms into well-defined evolutionary models, both as enabling and disabling constraints, may provide valuable insights and help us find the answers we seek.

During development, organisms form a distributed associative memory that allows for the "storage" and "recall" of multiple past phenotypes. This capability enables the accurate reconstruction of complete adult phenotypic patterns, even from partial or corrupted embryonic phenotypes. Additionally, this system "generalizes" by utilizing evolved developmental modules to generate new combinations of phenotypic features.

In this work, I aim to develop new models that incorporate trait variation, non-linear trait correlations, and frequency-dependent fitness. My hypothesis is that players will acquire abilities, such as recalling and innovating their own strategies, by leveraging previous associations.

In this example, two identical populations engage in a Lotka-Volterra Big Bully Game within a symmetrical setting. The initial traits and sizes of these populations determine how they impact one anotherâ€”for instance, a larger population tends to bully the smaller one.

I've integrated developmental memory into the model, allowing the correlation between traits to be stored as populations evolve toward more optimal conditions. This stored information shapes the future evolution of the populations, reflected as the planes that represent nearby mutants constricts and rotates.
