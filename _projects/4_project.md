Self developing strategies with trait correlations in adaptive landscapes:

How ecologically relevant (Qualitative) types arise from vast space of quantitative field of genotypes? (e.g. De-novo mutations in cancer)

Introduce developmental mechanisms into well-defined evolutionary models as both enabling and disabling constraints.

To construct new models that incorporate; trait variation, non-linear trait correlations, frequency-dependent fitness

Players will acquire abilities; e.g. recalling and innovate their own strategies with previous associations.

+Structured correlations among traits (e.g. gene regulatory networks)
	constrain or bias the distribution of phenotypes

Natural selection can alter such correlations

Formation of a distributed associative memory 					“store” and 	“recall” multiple past phenotypes
Recreate complete adult phenotypic patterns accurately from Partial or corrupted embryonic phenotypes
“generalize” by exploiting evolved developmental modules to produce new combinations of phenotypic features.
