  title={Game Theoretical Analysis of Cooperation and Cheating Among Lipase Producing Candida rugosa Sub-Cultures},
  author={{Yuksel O.*,} {Nikerel E.}},
  abstract={Game theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding social dilemmas and conflicts of interest among agents striving to maximize personal gain. In microbial populations, different phenotypes, such as complete or partial failure in exoenzyme production, can be seen as strategies in a game where cell growth rates indicate the fitness of each strategy. This research focuses on the interplay between wildtype "Cooperator" cells which exhibit plastic behavior by producing exoenzymes based on substrate concentrations, and "Cheater" cells that do not produce, with population productivity depending on the dynamics of exoenzyme production, transportation, and hydrolysis. We present a novel successive simulation methodology to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of lipase-producing Candida rugosa using kinetic fermentation models. Two main game regimes emerge: wildtype Cooperators dominate when the cost of lipase production is low, while at intermediate and higher costs, wildtype Cooperators coexist with Cheaters. Despite Cheaters benefiting from higher initial densities due to increased lipase excretion rates, wildtype Cooperators can cease enzyme production at utmost densities to regain dominance. Optimal productivity is attained at an initial total density of 0.06 g/L, with a final extracellular lipolytic activity of 4.68 U/mL, and Cooperators occupying 64% of the population in the evolutionary stable state. This suggests that complete elimination of Cheaters is not necessary to optimize exoenzyme production. Overall, our study provides a novel and comprehensive understanding of environmental currency and offers an innovative and robust framework for analyzing evolutionary stable states in microbial populations.},
